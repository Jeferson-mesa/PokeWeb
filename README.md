# PokeWeb
[Project developed based on ProgramateSchool CSS WorkBook]

The page contains 3 main sections where you can find:
    *Home:
       -It is the initial part of the page to know briefly what it is about. Contains a "message" in js that allows the user to enter the name they want and is displayed on the screen
    
    * Pokemon:
       -In this section there are 150 Pok√©mon distributed by cards in their categories with their real data, cards that allow the user to know more about pokemon
    
    *Play:
       -Finally there is the "Play" section that contains the pre-created game in the WorkBook, but it will be adapted with a redesign of all kinds, the user will be able to distract himself by catching the moving pokemons
